# Visual Design Review Skill

Review UI designs for clarity, hierarchy, and polish. Focus on actionable improvements.

## Typography Checklist

- **Hierarchy**: Is there clear distinction between heading levels? (size, weight, color)
- **Readability**: Line length (45-75 characters ideal), line height (1.4-1.6 for body text)
- **Consistency**: Same styles for same content types throughout
- **Weight distribution**: Bold used sparingly for emphasis, not decoration
- **Font sizing**: Logical scale (e.g., 1.25x or 1.333x ratio between levels)

## Spacing Checklist

- **Vertical rhythm**: Consistent spacing between similar elements
- **Grouping**: Related items closer together, unrelated items farther apart (proximity principle)
- **Breathing room**: Adequate whitespace around content blocks
- **Alignment**: Elements aligned to a consistent grid or baseline
- **Margins**: Consistent outer margins, inner padding proportional to container size

## Visual Hierarchy Checklist

- **Scannability**: Can you understand the structure in 3 seconds?
- **Entry points**: Clear starting point for the eye
- **Flow**: Natural reading path (F-pattern or Z-pattern for Western readers)
- **Emphasis**: Most important info stands out; secondary info recedes
- **Contrast**: Sufficient contrast between foreground/background (WCAG AA minimum)

## Component Design Checklist

- **Consistency**: Similar components look and behave the same
- **Affordance**: Interactive elements look clickable/tappable
- **States**: Hover, active, focus states defined
- **Sizing**: Touch targets at least 44px for mobile
- **Density**: Appropriate information density for context

## Color & Contrast Checklist

- **Palette cohesion**: Colors work together harmoniously
- **Semantic meaning**: Colors used consistently (e.g., red = error, green = success)
- **Accessibility**: Text contrast ratio meets WCAG standards
- **Overuse**: No more than 3-4 primary colors; avoid rainbow effect

## Common Issues to Flag

1. Inconsistent spacing between similar elements
2. Too many font sizes/weights creating visual noise
3. Insufficient contrast for readability
4. Misaligned elements breaking the visual grid
5. Competing focal points confusing hierarchy
6. Dense text blocks without visual breaks
7. Orphaned elements that feel disconnected
8. Inconsistent component styling

## Review Output Format

When reviewing, provide:
1. **What's working well** (2-3 points)
2. **Priority improvements** (ranked by impact)
3. **Specific fixes** (exact values/changes where possible)
