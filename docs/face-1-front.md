# Face 1: Resume

**Route:** `/front`
**Cube position:** Default front-facing face
**Design language:** Clean, minimal, light cream/off-white background

---

## Purpose

The "expected" face — a resume-style overview of Jake's career. Deliberately traditional in format to set up the contrast with the rest of the cube. The italic CTA at the bottom is the narrative hinge that invites visitors to explore deeper.

### Divider

Horizontal rule separating body from footer.

### Footer

- **Social links:** X | LinkedIn | GitHub | jake.rudolph@uwaterloo.ca (inline, pipe-separated)
- **Italic CTA:** "This page is what inspired my personal website concept. At face value, its resume-esque aesthetic is an accurate summary of my largest accomplishments and career milestones. But, it lacks depth and dimension. This 3-D cube site is built for people who truly want to learn about the faces that make me, me."

## Design Details

- **Background:** Light cream/off-white
- **Typography:** Clean, readable. Bold for emphasis on key metrics and company names.
- **Company logos:** Small favicon-size icons inline with company names. All company names are underlined links (external, new tab).
- **Bullet structure:** Primary bullets for roles, nested sub-bullets for details/achievements
- **Overall feel:** Intentionally traditional. This is a resume — the point is that it's *only* a resume, and the rest of the cube exists because a resume isn't enough.

---

## Mobile

- Standard responsive layout
- Vertical scroll
- Company logos and links remain inline
- Nav bar icons may need to shrink or reflow for small screens
