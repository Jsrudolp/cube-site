# Face 3: Building

**Route:** `/building`
**Design language:** Warm peach/salmon palette, toolbox metaphor, case study format

---

## Purpose

The deep-dive into Jake's product work. Where Face 1 (Resume) lists *what* he did, this face explains *how* he thinks about building. Structured around six core capabilities, each illustrated with real stories and screenshots.

## Layout

### Navigation

- **Top-left:** Face navigation icons. Current face icon (building) is visually distinct.
- **Top-right:** "Zoom Out" button

### Hero Section

- **Background:** Warm peach/salmon tone
- **Quote (centered):** "I figure out what's valuable, then build it *using whatever tools it takes.*" (second line in italics)
- **Toolbox illustration:** A red toolbox with tools (wrench, pliers, screwdriver, pencil, tape measure, etc.) — the visual metaphor for the six capabilities below

### Capability Sections

Six sections, one per capability. Each follows the same component structure but with alternating left/right layout:

**The six capabilities:**
1. Discovery
2. Design
3. AI-Native Engineering
4. Feedback Loops
5. Commercialization
6. Scrappiness

Each section supports a **hash anchor** (e.g., `/building#discovery`, `/building#scrappiness`).

### Section Component

Each capability section contains:

- **Title** — the capability name (e.g., "Discovery")
- **Metadata line:** Date | Role | Tags (e.g., "Fall 2025 | Product Builder | Tags")
- **Description paragraph** — a story about using this capability in real work. Focus is on *process and thinking*, not achievements.
- **Screenshot/image** — real work artifact (dashboards, designs, product screenshots, etc.)
- **Skill tags** — grouped by discipline:
  - PRODUCT: [tag] [tag]
  - ENGINEERING: [tag]
  - DESIGN: [tag]
  - Tags are pill/chip style

### Alternating Layout

- **Odd sections (1, 3, 5):** Text on left, image on right
- **Even sections (2, 4, 6):** Image on left, text on right

This creates a zigzag reading rhythm as you scroll.

## Design Details

- **Background:** Warm peach/salmon tones — distinct from all other faces
- **Toolbox:** Illustrated/graphic style (not photographic)
- **Screenshots:** Displayed in a slightly elevated card or with a subtle shadow to distinguish from the background
- **Skill tags:** Pill-shaped, light background with text. Grouped under bold discipline labels.
- **Typography:** Clean serif or sans-serif for titles, readable body text
- **Dividers:** Subtle background color shifts or spacing between sections (no harsh lines)
- **Overall feel:** A portfolio case study page, but warmer and more personal than typical. The toolbox grounds it in metaphor rather than corporate language.

## Content Status

Content and design for this face are **still in progress**. The structure and component pattern are defined, but individual capability stories and screenshots are being finalized.

## Mobile

- Alternating layout collapses to single-column: title, image, description, tags (stacked vertically)
- Toolbox illustration scales proportionally
- Screenshots scale to full width
- Hash anchors still work for deep linking
